## Team Charter
*Make a project that actually works*

My Team members have not communicated other common goals to form a better charter.

## Product Mission Statement
*A STEM theme that displays an engineering concept for a display that is interactive and web-enabled.*

This was quickly formed from the project discription and still needs further development as the team continues to form.
