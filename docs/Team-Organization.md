## Team Charter
Our team is building a robotic arm to help K–12 students learn about STEM through fun, hands-on activities. Each team member works on different parts like the design, coding, and electronics to make it safe and easy to use. We focus on working together and making the experience creative, engaging, and accessible for all students.


## Product Mission Statement
Our mission is to inspire the next generation of innovators by providing K–12 students with a hands-on, interactive robotic arm that fosters curiosity, creativity, and a passion for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Through engaging learning experiences, our robotic arm empowers students to explore the fundamentals of robotics, programming, and problem-solving in a fun, safe, and educational environment.


## Team Goals
1. Design a safe and durable robotic arm that all ages can use.
2. Make an easy control system that helps all ages be able to use and learn basic concepts of it.
3. Include STEM learning objectives to help all ages gain knowledge of it.
4. Each member is responisble for communicating and meeting deadlines to help achieve the project.


## Team Communication Channels

| Name | First Communication Choice | Second Communication Choice | Third Communcation Choice |
