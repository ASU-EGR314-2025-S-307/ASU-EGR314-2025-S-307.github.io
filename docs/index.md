## Robotic Arm

Welcome to our team 307 report on the development of an educational robotic arm designed for Kâ€“12 students. This project aims to introduce young learners to the fundamentals of STEM through a safe, interactive, and hands-on experience. Our team collaborated across mechanical design, coding, and electronics to create a user-friendly system. We hope this report provides a clear overview of our process, goals, and the impact we aim to achieve in STEM education.
